# Thankyou https://github.com/christianversloot for the simple yet trustworthy solution to detect fishes
When I first came across the fish doorbell project, this was the initial idea that went through my head. I knew it would be possible
to automate the process of detecting the fishes and ringing the doorbell, so I wanted to create it. Just as I was scouting github for
inspirations, I came across https://github.com/christianversloot and his https://github.com/christianversloot/fish-doorbell repo. Seeing that
the solution is already implemented and that too very simplistic, I wanted to try out additional things here. I already had the idea to detect the species of the passing fishes and then use the data to predict the migration patterns of specific species with respect to different seasons, sort of like a fish migration forcaster. 

This V2 version on top of detecting the presence of the fish, tries to identify the species of the fish using
the Azure AI vision.
Just keep in mind that this was created with a single days effort and for the time being the AI Vision model is trained using using the data
of two different species of fishes.These images are present in the training_images folder. In future versions of the project I plan on capturing images
from the fish doorbell cam itself and train the model on those images so that the training can be done on the murky water conditions and poor visibility conditions of the  Weerdsluis lock.

## What is the Fish Doorbell?

## How it works
The doorbell is automated in `doorbell.py`. It runs the `run_doorbell_on_images()` definition, which itself runs `run_doorbell_on_image()` on every image that it encounters in a folder called `./images`.

### On applying computer vision
Detecting whether fish are present in an image is a classification problem with two classes: no fish present (0) or fish present (1). In computer vision, there are three broad classes for detecting fish, with their pros and cons:

1. **Supervised Learning** (ranging from simple ConvNet-based classifiers to YOLO-like object detection/segmentation models).
  * (+) Highly accurate if trained properly. Work well with relatively complex data space (e.g. with varying image backgrounds and such).
  * (-) Requires large datasets (preferably a few thousand images at minimum) that are also well-balanced. Requires human labeling which takes time and money.
2. **Self-Supervised Learning** (with approaches like RotNet) to generate feature extractors that can be used in downstream approaches.
  * (+) Can extract features that are most relevant to each class without supervision i.e. without the need for human labeling. Work well with relatively complex data space (e.g. with varying image backgrounds and such).
  * (-) Takes time. Requires additional downstream tinkering or supervised learning to work well on the classification task.
3. **Classic Computer Vision methods** (i.e. OpenCV-style).
  * (+) Doesn't require a lot of training data. Can work extremely well if environment is simple. Doesn't require any labeling.
  * (-) Doesn't work too well if environment is varied. Requires human understanding about what makes an object an object. 

It is unsurprising to see that computer vision has moved from (3) to (1) and somewhat to (2) in the past few years. Still, a problem should be solved in a way that is both effective and simple. We don't need overengineering.

### Selecting a method for our fish
Regarding the fish, here are some images retrieved from [here](https://visdeurbel.nl/beelden/). These are some observations:

1. The dataset is scarce (only a few dozen images).
2. The dataset is imbalanced (only fish).
3. The environment is simple (colors don't change much, especially considering they can be made grayscale; background is always gray and even).

That's why the Fish Doorbell detector uses classic computer vision methods as they can likely work given the past few three constraints and their impact on the first two approaches.

### How the detector works.
The `run_doorbell_on_image()` def performs the following steps:

1. **Loading the image.** Use OpenCV (in `load_image()`) as a grayscale image. Loading the image as a grayscale makes the algorithm invariant to color. This will already help fix the issues with relatively blue-gray and green-gray water color throughout the day.
2. **Image cropping.** Cut off the top and bottom text by cropping 50 px on both sides (`crop_image()`). This is necessary because downstream CV approaches will otherwise detect the text as an object.
3. **Apply blur.** Pixel issues and noise in the background can be detected as an object (and thus as fish) sometimes. By applying `(15, 15)` Gaussian blur (`apply_blur()`), this issue is solved.
4. **Canny edge detection.** Use canny edge detection to detect edges in the image. Because the background is static (and made even more so by applying blur), any edges will be caused by objects in the image - which are likely fish!
5. **Fish detection.** Simply check (in `has_fish()`) whether > 50 pixels are part of an edge. If so, an object is present.
6. **Display the results.** Show the original picture and edged out one with the class on screen.

### How the species identifier works.
The logic for identifying the species of the fish is coupled with the `run_doorbell_on_image()` method. The `has_fish()`
returns a boolean value indicating whether a fish is present in the frame or not.When it returns a true value
the `identify_species()` is called which takes care of converting the image to byte content and sending it across the 
Custom AI Vision models rest endpoint and plotting in the results.

## Running the code yourself
Running the code yourself is very easy:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies - which are a recent version of Python (preferably in some environment) and the dependencies (OpenCV2, Matplotlib, NumPy) through `pip install requirements.txt`.
3. Run `doorbell.py`.
